## Rules for writing docs

These docs are written mainly for Claude, so they are built to be cheap to route and read:

- **Frontmatter on every file:** `summary` (one line), `read_when` (the trigger), `updated` (YYYY-MM-DD). You can scan all of it with `head -5 docs/**/*.md`.
- **One topic per file, under ~300 lines.** Split a file before it grows past that.
- **Stable `##` headings** so a section can be found with grep and read on its own.
- **Put rules in lists or tables.** Keep prose for the "why".
- **Use concrete numeric examples** for domain rules. They double as test cases.
- **Mark uncertainty** with **Open question:** or **Assumption:**. Never state a guess as fact.
- **Don't duplicate code.** Link the path (`apps/api/src/...`) and describe intent.
- **Public repo: no real data.** Use placeholders (Member A/B, Card X, round amounts). Real household facts go to the production DB or `.private/` (gitignored).
- **Glossary terms are canonical.** Use the English code name and add the Portuguese term the first time it appears if that helps.
