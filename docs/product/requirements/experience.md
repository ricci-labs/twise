# Experience

Product context: `../vision.md` and `../household-finances.md`.

## Name and slogan
**Twise — Leve, claro, a dois.** The line under it, where there is room (login, empty home, e-mails):
"Claro para os dois, leve para o bolso: o app que mostra quanto vocês ainda podem gastar no mês."
Both come from `../vision.md` → Name.

## The promise
**Know in seconds how much is still free to spend, and never be surprised by a card invoice.**
Every screen serves one of three questions:
1. How are we this period? (spent, committed, free to spend, per day)
2. What is coming? (bills, invoices, installments, balance going negative)
3. Who owes what? (contacts, charges)

Recording is quick and usually happens on WhatsApp. The web is where the couple **sees, checks,
fixes and plans**, so it favours clarity over speed of entry, while still making a new entry quick
on the phone.

## People
Placeholders only (the repo is public).
- **Member A:** fixed salary, organises the household money, checks the web a few times a week on
  the phone and sometimes on a laptop. Wants the full picture and to fix mistakes.
- **Member B:** fixed salary plus variable sales commissions. Mostly records by WhatsApp. Opens the
  web to see "how much can I spend" and to decide what to do with a commission.
- **A contact:** a friend or relative who shares purchases. Never logs in; receives charges by
  WhatsApp with a Pix code.
- **A viewer:** someone invited to look (e.g. an accountant or a parent helping), who can't change
  anything.

## Principles
1. **Mobile first, one hand.** Designed at 360 px wide; the main actions are reachable with the
   thumb. Desktop gets more columns, never different features.
2. **Numbers you can trust at a glance.** Money is always formatted the same way, signs and colours
   are consistent, and a number never appears without saying what it is and for which period.
3. **Say what happened, and what to do next.** Every action ends in visible feedback; every error
   says what is wrong and how to fix it, in plain pt-BR (`ui-standards.md`, `error-messages.md`).
4. **Nothing is lost by accident.** Deletes go to the trash and can be restored; destructive
   actions ask for confirmation; forms warn before discarding typed data.
5. **Show only what the person may do.** The UI follows the role's permissions; the API is still
   the final guard.
6. **Calm, not noisy.** Alerts (insights) are ranked, with at most a few on screen; warnings are
   informative, not alarming.
7. **Explain the finance terms.** Words like "comprometido", "livre para gastar", "fechamento" have
   a short help text one tap away.

| J11 | First run: log in, create the workspace, add accounts, cards and categories | `AUTH-01`, `WS-01`, `ACC-01`, `CARD-01` |

## Navigation
**Mobile:** a bottom bar with five items, and a floating **"Novo lançamento"** button above it on
the screens where recording makes sense.

| Item | Label | Opens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Início" | `HOME-01` |
| 2 | "Lançamentos" | `ENT-01` |
| 3 | "Cartões" | `CARD-01` |
| 4 | "Planejamento" | `PLAN-01` |
| 5 | "Mais" | A menu: contacts and charges, accounts and categories, members, settings, history, trash, my account, log out |

**Desktop (≥ 1024 px):** a left sidebar with the same sections, collapsible to icons; "Novo
lançamento" as the primary button at the top, the workspace switcher and the account at the foot
(`SHELL-01`).

**Always visible:** the current workspace name, with a switcher when the user has more than one
(`SHELL-01`).

Items the role can't open are hidden, not disabled (`ui-standards.md` → Permissions).
