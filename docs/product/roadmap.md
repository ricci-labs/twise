- [x] Domain functions with tests: money, installments + multi-party allocation, billing cycle, financial period
- [x] DB foundation: Postgres 18, owner/app roles, Drizzle migrations, `users` + `workspaces` with RLS, isolation tests in CI
- [x] DB: access control (`module_actions`, `roles`, `role_permissions`)
- [x] DB: memberships (owner invariant) + workspace creation service
- [x] DB: settings and preferences (`workspace_settings`, `user_preferences`, `membership_preferences`)
- [x] DB: invitations (create + accept flow)
- [x] Review of the tenancy/access base (3 bugs fixed: #13, #14, #15; model alignment: #16, #17)
- [x] `onboarding` module for flows spanning modules (#18)
- [x] DB: ledger accounts (tree, system accounts)
- [x] DB: journal entries + postings (balanced, immutable, soft delete)
- [x] Ledger services: postings planner + record / change / delete / restore / replace entry
- [x] Ledger account services: create / change / archive / delete / restore
- [x] DB: cards and invoices (tables, card creation, invoice rules)
- [x] Card purchases in installments, invoice payment
- [x] Purchases already in progress: record only the remaining installments
- [x] DB: balance views (`account_balances`, `invoice_totals`)
- [x] **Ledger series done** (#19–#27): accounts, entries, cards, installments, invoices, balances
- [x] **HTTP API + web auth** (chosen 2026-09-25, done 2026-09-26, #29–#54; password login, ADR 0021):
  1. [x] ADRs 0021 (auth) and 0022 (email), and this plan
  2. [x] `identity`: `sessions` and `auth_tokens` tables, password hashing (scrypt)
  3. [x] `identity`: create user, login, resolve session, logout services
  3b. [x] `ops:create-user` script (first user + first workspace, password typed without echo)
  4. [x] Email: `core/email` `Mailer` with Nodemailer (ADR 0022), `.eml` outbox in development
  5. [x] `identity`: sign-up (behind `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_ENABLED`), email verification
  5b. [x] `identity`: forgot password and reset by email
  6. [x] HTTP core: error handler (`AppError` → status, error ref), request id, request logger
  7. [x] Auth routes: login, logout, me, config; session required by default; same-origin writes
  7b. [x] Login rate limit (per email and per client IP)
  7c. [x] Routes that send account emails: sign-up, verification resend, forgot password (202, limits)
  7d. [x] Routes that use the links: verify email, reset password (with limits on failed links)
  8. [x] `authorize(module, action)` middleware + workspace routes (`/api/workspaces/:workspaceId/...`)
     and a test that fails when a route has no permission
  8b. [x] `GET /api/workspaces`: the caller's workspaces (narrow SECURITY DEFINER lookup, ADR 0019)
  9. [x] Ledger routes: accounts
  9b. [x] Ledger routes: cards and invoices
  9c. [x] Ledger routes: entries
  9d. [x] Ledger routes: balances
  10. [x] Invitation routes: create (email or link to share), list pending, revoke; owner-only owner invites
  10b. [x] Invitation routes: preview, accept (email must match)
  10c. [x] Invitation routes: accept with sign-up
  Along the way: strict file roles, Claude Code hooks and the `new-module` / `pr` skills (#43–#46).
- [ ] **Backend completion** (chosen 2026-09-26): finish the whole domain backend before the
  frontend; the web comes next, and the WhatsApp channel with the agent comes last, reusing the
  services. Small PRs, in order:
  1. [ ] **Gaps in what exists** (tables already exist):
     - [x] Workspaces: create through the API, rename, settings (financial period, currency,
           installment view, budget base…)
     - [x] Members: list, change role, remove, leave (owner rules, last owner kept)
     - [x] Custom roles and their permission matrix (no privilege escalation)
     - [x] My account: change password while logged in, display name, preferences
     - [x] Ledger reading: lines of an invoice, trash of accounts and entries, keyset paging of
           entries
     - [x] Maintenance job (croner): purge expired sessions and expired auth tokens, daily
  2. [x] **Planning + dashboard** (decided 2026-09-26, done 2026-09-26, #65–#85, ADR 0024;
         `../domain/model/planning.md`):
     - [x] Plan: ADR 0024 (metrics and insights over period facts) and this list
     - [x] Holidays and business-day math: national bank holidays computed, workspace holidays
     - [x] Recurrence rules + planned occurrences, 6 months ahead (planned on rule changes and
           topped up on reading; the nightly cross-workspace job comes with the reminders)
     - [x] Matching real entries to pending occurrences, suggested and confirmed; matches follow
           edited or deleted entries; skip / edit one occurrence
     - [x] Budget lines and goals (with the reserve)
     - [x] Period facts + first metrics + `GET /overview` (free to spend, per day, spent, committed)
     - [x] More metrics: budget pace, committed ahead (6 periods), next invoice, variable income
           average, reserve coverage
     - [x] Insights (first set) in the overview
     - [x] Commission split: allocation steps, suggested transfers, insight for commission not
           yet split
     - [x] Balance forecast per account
     - [x] "Posso comprar?" purchase simulation
  3. [x] **Contacts, charges and settlements** (model in `../domain/model/third-parties.md`,
         approved 2026-09-22; done 2026-09-26, #87–#98). Sending over WhatsApp comes with the outbox (step
         4) and the channel; here a charge is built up to its message and Pix copia-e-cola:
     - [x] `contacts` module: table and routes (name, phone, notes, opt-out)
     - [x] `postings.contact_id`: receivable/payable lines carry their contact (CHECK row 4)
     - [x] Splitting expenses and card purchases with contacts (several, across installments)
     - [x] `settlement` entries: a contact pays back
     - [x] Contact balances (owed, overdue, next due), archive when settled, own vs fronted on card
           invoices
     - [x] Charges: `charges` + `charge_items`, built from a contact's open items, pt-BR message,
           Pix copia-e-cola from the workspace key; mark sent; cancel
     - [x] Settlements pay charges (`charge_payments`, paid / partially paid derived)
     - [x] Insight: a contact with overdue items
  4. [x] **Reminders:** notification outbox and its worker, email first (done 2026-09-26, #99–#104;
         jobs across workspaces per ADR 0025, no bypass role):
     - [x] `job_workspace_ids()` + `forEachWorkspace`, and the nightly occurrence planning job
     - [x] `notifications` module: `notification_outbox`, enqueue with a dedupe key, quiet hours
     - [x] Worker job: claim due rows, render pt-BR emails, send, retry with backoff
     - [x] Reminders of bills and card invoices, by each member's lead time
     - [x] Members' notification preferences through the API
  5. [x] **Attachments** on entries (`FileStorage`) (started 2026-09-27; the user asked for steps 5 and
         6 in a row):
     - [x] `core/storage`: `FileStorage` + local disk, `FILE_STORAGE_DIR`, `FILE_MAX_BYTES`
     - [x] `attachments` module: `files` + `entry_attachments`, upload, list, download, detach
     - [x] Charge attachments (payment receipts) and the purge of trashed files after 30 days
  6. [x] **Audit log** (ADR 0026; done 2026-09-27):
     - [x] Operation context (trace id + source for HTTP and jobs), `audit_log` append-only,
           `recordAudit`, `GET /audit`, entries audited
     - [x] Audit the other writes: accounts, cards, contacts, charges, planning, attachments
     - [x] Audit settings, members, roles and invitations
  7. [ ] **Observability core and deploy** (started 2026-09-27; decisions 7, 8 and 10 below):
     - [x] Decisions and plan (this list)
     - [x] Metrics: OTel metrics SDK + Prometheus exporter on `:9464`, the metric registry, HTTP,
           job and notification metrics (error metrics come with the fingerprints)
     - [x] Error fingerprints (`type:code:top-frame`), `financas_app_errors_total` and fatal process handlers
     - [x] Dockerfile (multi-stage; migrations run before the app, without leaving the owner URL
           to the app process) + image build check on PRs
     - [x] `deploy.yml`: push `:<sha>` and `:main` to GHCR on `main`; redeploy from Dokploy (no
           webhook: GitHub can't reach Dokploy)
     - [x] Backups: `pg_dump` + attachments archive, 14 days kept locally, optional offsite copy
           through an rclone remote, Uptime Kuma heartbeat; restore script tested and documented
     - [x] `ops:*` scripts: health, logs, trace, errors, metrics, job
     - [x] **First deploy, with the user** (2026-09-28): app, database, tunnel and daily backups
           running, with Uptime Kuma monitors and Netdata charts. Left for later: Cloudflare
           Access, the Postman service token, SMTP credentials, the first real user and the
           alert channel (checklist in `../operations/deploy.md`)
  8. [x] **Web requirements** (2026-09-29, #127–#128): experience, non-functional requirements, UI
         standards, design system brief, error messages and every screen per module
         (`requirements/`), for prototyping in Claude Design.
  9. [x] **API gaps before the web** (2026-09-29, #129–#134; `requirements/api-gaps.md` G1–G7):
         500s mapped to clear errors, emails after a change sent in the background, reads of one
         entry, contact or charge, charge item details and a contact's open items. `packages/shared`
         grouped by area (#135).
  Then: **web foundation**, then **WhatsApp channel + agent**. The agent's tools include
  `simulate_purchase` ("posso comprar?", built in #85, decided 2026-09-26), next to `period_overview`.
- [x] DB: contacts/charges, planning, support tables
- [x] Observability core (metrics, error fingerprints and refs), Dockerfile, deploy workflow
- [x] **Web foundation** (approved 2026-10-01; done 2026-10-02). Standards first (ADR 0027,
  `../architecture/web-application.md`, `../architecture/web-components.md`,
  `../architecture/web-design-tokens.md`); their checks land before the first screen. One PR each:
  1. [x] Standards docs (ADR 0027 + the three web docs) (#141)
  2. [x] Web tests: Vitest browser mode (Chromium), axe helper, web tests in `pnpm check` and CI
  3. [x] Tokens: `styles/tokens/` with placeholder values until the Claude Design system, the font,
     dark mode without inline script, shadcn init (Base UI), `cn`
  4. [x] Web checks: `lint:tokens`, `lint:copy`, `check:contrast` (#148); web file roles and
     every web import rule (#149)
  5. [x] Claude Code: web checks in the hooks; `new-component` and `new-feature` skills (#144)
  6. [x] React Compiler and Biome's React rules
  7. [x] Router + Query + `unwrap`/`ApiError`, guards, empty app shell (#153); error messages
     map (the 403 toast and the offline banner come with their components)
  8. [x] Workbench `/dev/components` with the Tokens page
  9. [x] The API serves the SPA (cache headers, SPA fallback, CSP) and the image ships it
  10. [x] PWA (shell and owl-scene precache, update toast) and `check:bundle`
  Then the account area (user's go-ahead 2026-10-01, design in `../design/account/`), one PR each:
  11. [x] Account components, in the order of `../design/account/components.md`: Button (#156),
      fields and forms (#157), Alert, Tip, Banner, toasts (#158), StepTrack, OwlScene, Logo (#159),
      AuthLayout, MomentScreen, AppSplash
  12. [x] `AUTH-01` log in, with `SHELL-01` session handling (arrival messages, `next`, log out)
  13. [x] `AUTH-02` sign up and its "Confira seu e-mail" handoff
  14. [x] `AUTH-03` verify email
  15. [x] `AUTH-04` forgot password (#164) and `AUTH-05` reset password
  16. [x] `INV-01` invitation
  17. [x] `SHELL-01` app opening (splash; its entrance and the 1.2 s rule come with 18)
  18. [x] Owl motion (`../design/account/motion.md`): the 8 designed sequences on the layered kits
  Then the other screens, in the order of `requirements/README.md`.
- [ ] **Home round: shell, workspace and Home** (design `../design/home/`, every proposal approved
  by the user on 2026-10-09; order docs → API → web; one PR each, merged by Claude when CI is green):
  1. [x] Design package in `docs/design/home/` (#180)
  2. [x] Requirements: `HOME-01`, `SHELL-01`, `WS-01`, navigation, API gaps G25–G34 (#181)
  3. [x] Demo household: a typed fixture in `packages/shared` (period 5 out – 4 nov, today 20 out,
     budget income R$ 9.000,00, the design's numbers) with scenarios (current, overspent, closed,
     no alerts, first run); a test proves `computeMetrics` gives the design's numbers. The web
     tests and workbench use it, and later the public demo page
  4. [x] Overview: `periodProgress`, `spendingAverage`, no pace alarm before a period starts (G25, G26, G35)
  5. [x] Overview: `incomeShare`, `periodPace` (G27, G28)
  6. [x] Overview: `billsDue` + occurrence description in `occurrence_overdue` (G29, G9)
  7. [x] Overview: `frontedCents` on next invoices, `receivables` (G30, G31)
  8. [x] Overview: reserve percent, `goalProgress`, `variableVsAverage` (G32, G33)
  9. [x] Overview: `periodSummary`, part 1: left over and positive streak (G34)
  10. [x] Overview: `periodSummary`, part 2: budgets within limit, bills on time, reserve added,
      goals progress (G34)
  11. [x] Web: Twise icons, the navigation components and the shell (collapsible sidebar, bottom bar, "Mais" sheet,
      period picker, workspace switcher, account menu)
  12. [x] Web: `WS-01` and the workspace routes (the owl entrance comes with the motion, 17)
  13. [x] Web: Card, KPI card and carousel, section skeleton / error, empty state (and `Amount`)
  14. [x] Web: charts (balance forecast, coming months, pace, budget rows, income bar)
  15. [x] Web: `HOME-01` mobile and desktop, with the demo household
  16. [ ] Web: Home states (negative, closed + achievements, no alerts, no config, offline,
      viewer, section error) and first run
  17. [ ] Web: Home motion (`../design/home/motion.md`)
- [ ] Remaining project skills (`new-module`, `db-migration`, `domain-rule`, `pr`) and Claude Code hooks

## Phase 1: MVP
Goal: the couple records everything through WhatsApp and the web, and always knows how much is still free to spend.

- Auth, workspaces, memberships, invitations, settings (financial period, budget view, reminders)
- Ledger: accounts, cash, cards, categories, opening balances; entries with reversal
- Cards: invoices, installments, invoice payment
- Contacts: shared purchases (several contacts, installments), charges sent over WhatsApp, settlements
- Planning: recurring bills and incomes, planned occurrences with matching, budgets, reserve goal
- Reminders: bills, invoices, charges (outbox)
- Attachments on entries (web upload + WhatsApp photo)
- WhatsApp agent (text): expenses, incomes, transfers, settlements, charges, overview, undo; always confirmed
- Dashboard: period overview (fixed income, spent, committed, free to spend), invoices (own vs others), contacts, upcoming bills
- Deploy on Dokploy with backups and Level 0 observability

## Phase 2
- Audio messages (transcription step; see `../integrations/ai-agent.md`)
- Receipt photos (Claude vision)
- Auto-recorded recurring entries (`auto_record`)
- Daily/weekly WhatsApp digest
- Commission waterfall automation
- NFC-e QR code reading (itemized receipts)
- Anti-ban practices for contact messaging

## Phase 3
- Statement and invoice import (OFX/CSV/PDF) with reconciliation against recorded transactions
- Goals and emergency reserve tracking
- Reports: month over month, category trends
- Cross-workspace grouped view
- Opening to friends: onboarding, invitations at scale, LGPD export/erasure flows

## Open questions
1. Real data for the couple's setup (accounts, cards, closing/due days, pay days): collected at onboarding, stored only in the DB, never in the repo.
2. Refund of installment purchases (`../domain/billing-and-installments.md`).
3. ~~Web auth method~~: password with server-side sessions, sign-up switch, reset by email (ADR 0021, ADR 0022).
4. Transcription for audio: local whisper.cpp vs external API.
5. Model for the agent: default `claude-opus-5`; test cheaper models once real message samples exist.
6. Alert channel (ntfy, Telegram, email). Must not be WhatsApp.
7. ~~Remote access~~: **Cloudflare Tunnel + Cloudflare Access** (2026-09-27): any browser, no app to install, a one-time email code before the app's login; deploys are started from Dokploy (`../operations/deploy.md`).
8. Offsite backup destination: the structure is ready (an rclone remote, off until set, 2026-09-27). Choose later between an S3-compatible bucket with a good free tier and the user's OneDrive.
9. Anti-ban practices for charges sent to contacts.
10. ~~Email provider~~: **DreamHost SMTP** (2026-09-27), set through the `SMTP_*` env vars at deploy time. The sender domain needs SPF/DKIM, which DreamHost provides for domains it hosts.
